abstract = { Data-driven assistive wearable technologies are promising to support young adults
with neurodiversity in inclusive education. Existing datasets focus on wearable sensor
data of various activities from neurotypical people. However, no dataset exists including
learning-related activity data from individuals with neurodiversity. The contributions
of this paper include (1) WLA4ND, a dataset of learning activities performed by eight
young adults with neurodiversity collected from smartwatch sensors. The activities
are common learning tasks, including reading, writing, typing, answering follow-up
questions, and off-task. (2) Evaluation of classification on WLA4ND with five activity
recognition models, including conventional and deep learning methods. The Convolutional
Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model achieved a balanced accuracy of 92.2% for user-dependent
evaluations, while Federated Multi-Task Hierarchical Attention Model (FATHOM) achieved
91.8% for user-independent evaluations. This evaluation demonstrates that existing
activity recognition technologies can be applied to neurodiverse populations. Also,
WLA4ND can be used by researchers as a complement for activity recognition, automatic
labeling, and next-generation assistive wearable applications. },
