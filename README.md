# -WLA4ND


The WLA4ND dataset consists of data collected with a set of wearable sensors, representing learning activities from eight participants with neurodiversity. Among the eight participants, there are three females and five males (according to self-reports), all were alumni from Mason LIFE, the inclusive postsecondary education program for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The participants self-reported their disability types. Regarding their demographic profile, seven participants were White-Caucasian, and one was African-American. All eight participants used their right hand as dominant hand. The average age of the participants was 28.5 years old, ranging from 23 to 31 years old. 

The data was collected from five smartwatch built-in sensors, including 13 dimensions of features, being 12 dimensions of features from four motion sensors and one feature from the heart rate sensor. For those four motion sensors that measure vectors in three axes (x, y, z) relative to the smartwatch, we included data from the gyroscope (raw rotations), accelerometer (raw accelerations), linear acceleration (accelerations excluding gravity), and gravity sensors to measure the corresponding acceleration vectors. Heart rate sensors were used to measure the number of beats per minute (bpm) in one vector. For the raw data, around 500 raw time points in total were collected from five sensor sources per second. 

For details:

- The "WLA4ND" dataset is for the  dataset.

- The "modles code" is for the classification code.
